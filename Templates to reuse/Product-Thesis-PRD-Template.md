# [THESIS TITLE HERE]

## **WRITING STYLE GUIDELINES FOR THIS TEMPLATE:**

**CRITICAL: Keep PRDs to 1.5-2 pages maximum. Engineers won't read verbose docs.**

**Format Rules:**
- Use BULLETS, not prose paragraphs
- Each section should be 3-5 concise bullets max
- No long explanations - just key facts and data
- Make it scannable - engineer should read entire doc in 3-5 minutes

**Timeline/Budget Section Approach:**
- Frame time as a CONSTRAINT (how much time we have), not an ESTIMATE (how long it takes)
- Include business reason for deadline
- Mark team capacity as "TBD with eng" - collaborative, not prescriptive
- List proposed phases for DISCUSSION, not mandated milestones
- Always include: "Open question for eng: What fits in the time budget? What moves to V2?"

**Evidence & Data:**
- Match customer quotes and data to the specific theme/use case of the PRD
- Include percentages and metrics inline with bullets
- No separate "research findings" sections - weave data into relevant sections

## Why are we working on this next?
Includes any market forces and tie into company strategies why we're working on it
Includes any metrics that are relevant to justify the decision.

## When and how do people use this feature?
List all the personas that this applies to. Ideally, many of the personas that already use our product will also use this.
Try to include numbers where possible so people understand what % of each group applies to each one.
The use cases are intended to be specific enough that the design and engineering team can easily imagine how someone would use the solution they're building and why.

## What Problems Do We need to Solve? (in order of priority)
If this is an existing feature, this will include the known problems with how the feature currently exists and what the problems are behind the use cases above.
Use short gifs/videos & mark up screenshots to show the issues where you can.
If this is a new feature, this is focused on the core problems that fit in the use cases above.

## How much time is budgeted for this project? When do we need to be completed with this by?
List how many weeks you have for this project and a target ship date, or time when it's in QA and ready for your deploy process.
Your eng and design team need to know how big a project this can be so you can talk tradeoffs and scope effectively.
Your stakeholders need to know when you'll deliver this project so they can plan accordingly for how they'll act based on this launch.

## What are Future Considerations that must be accounted for?
If there is anything we're doing now that applies to future efforts, these are added so engineering and design can keep them in mind as they work on the solution.
If you descope something and think you'll revisit it in the next 6-12 months, note it here.

## How does this tie back to this quarter's OKR(s)?
A single sentence explaining which of your OKRs this project relates to, why it does, and a link back to your OKRs document, if applicable.

## What is our KPI or Metric for this Thesis?
We choose a KPI to measure success vs. failure of the project. We set a goal improvement on an existing metric (with a baseline measurement) or a new measure that we'd start tracking when we launch with a goal of what we hope it will be.

## Who are the stakeholders and how/when do they need to be involved?
Just like in our OKR documents, list out the Name, Department, and when and how you expect them to be involved in the project. One name per bullet.

## What Marketing Tier is this?
Using this guide, note what tier your product is.
Tier 1 and 2 items you should already be talking to marketing. Tier 3 should get a heads up and check in as you approach launch. Tier 4 and below don't matter.
If you are in the Revver pod, coordinate with the Community team the same way.

## Further Reading:
This is where you show your work. Provide links relevant to building this solution...may include similar products or designs that can inspire it.
Treat this as a Table of Contents of the work that went into generating this document so people can easily jump into an area that is most interesting to them.
Add links to customer research, feedback, usability testing, surveys, survey analysis, specific analytics reports or queries, etc.
