description: "Facilitates the second step of a proven ideal-customer (ICP) method: distilling raw company observations into the few deep-truth attributes that matter, then classifying each as a strength, a weakness, or deliberately both. Takes an observations list (O1, O2, … — file or pasted), proposes attributes one at a time with their supporting observations, kills generic ones with the Opposite Test ('we love our customers' dies), classifies each with a concrete rubric (a third of the market sees it that way, or some customers buy/refuse for it alone), and records the result in STRENGTHS-WEAKNESSES.md (S1, S2, … / W1, W2, …). Load when the user has raw observations and wants to distill them, asks 'what are our real strengths and weaknesses,' or wants to classify what they learned from the honest-look exercise. Do NOT load to gather the raw observations (the previous step), to derive keystones or deal-breakers from classified attributes (later steps), or for a person's individual strengths and weaknesses."

# Strengths & Weaknesses: The Attributes That Matter

Raw observations are evidence; strategy needs a verdict. This skill
turns a pile of honest facts about a company into a short chart of
classified attributes — the strengths a future ideal customer will love
you for, and the weaknesses she'll either tolerate or be repelled by.
Two moves, in order: distill the observations into the few deep truths
underneath them, then classify each one with a rubric that resolves the
paradox that almost anything can be argued either way.

## The mental model

### Observations → deep truths

The facts we notice are usually consequences of something deeper.
"Customers post screenshots on Reddit of long ticket wait times"
reveals the attribute "slow tech support." "Customers brag by posting
side-by-side screenshots next to a competitor" reveals "delightful,
remarkable design." Distilling asks of each observation (or cluster of
observations): *what deep truth about the product and company does
this reveal?* Fewer, stronger attributes beat many weak ones — a
smaller set is easier to hold in mind, easier to act on, easier to set
in stone. Merge observations that point at the same truth; drop ones
that point nowhere.

### The genericness trap and the Opposite Test

The fatal failure mode of distillation is generalizing an attribute
into banality. "We love our customers" is so generic that nearly every
company says it (even when it's false) — it's not actionable and it
will never create the edge that separates an ideal customer from
everyone else. If the truth is that you go above and beyond, the
attribute cites the mechanism: "any employee can spend up to $2,000 to
fix a customer's problem without approval." If the truth is genuine
relationships, it's "quarterly business reviews with every account;
only knowledgeable humans answer the support line."

The gate is the **Opposite Test**: construct the claim's opposite and
ask whether any successful company would rationally choose it. "Easy
to use" fails — nobody claims "difficult to use." "Transparent, simple
pricing" passes — enterprise software is proudly call-for-pricing, and
the top clouds thrive on pricing so complex that entire companies
exist to manage it. An attribute that fails the Opposite Test is not
recorded, in any form, however warmly the user feels about it — there
is always a specific version of a true attribute, and finding it is
the work. (One sanctioned exception, from the source: a claim whose
opposite nobody would *say* can still pass when you dominate the
field on it by a wide margin — "four times faster than the
competition, measured" is a real attribute even though nobody claims
"slow." The domination must be specific and large, not vibes.)

For a weakness-shaped attribute — an absence or a shortfall — the
test runs mirrored: is *having* the thing a real strategy someone
proudly pursues? "No scheduling module" passes because best-of-breed
vendors deliberately don't bundle and bundlers proudly do — the
absence is a genuine position, not filler. "Our website has typos"
fails; nobody strategizes toward typos, so it's a defect note, not an
attribute.

### The classification rubric

Whether an attribute is a strength or weakness is entirely in the eye
of the beholder — "inexpensive" attracts price-conscious buyers and
repels serious ones. So the call is made with two concrete questions:

1. **Strength** — is at least one of these true?
   a. More than one-third of the market considers this a strength.
   b. Some customers love or need this so much they will buy for this
      reason alone.
2. **Weakness** — is at least one of these true?
   a. More than one-third of the market considers this a weakness.
   b. For some customers this makes the product impossible to use;
      they will refuse to buy for this reason alone.

Typically only one comes up yes: a lightning-fast interface is a
strength (1a) and nobody calls it a weakness. Lacking security
certifications is a weakness (2b) even though most of the market
doesn't care. But two other outcomes matter just as much:

- **Yes to both** → the attribute is *both*, listed in both columns
  and flagged: different market segments disagree about it, which
  means a clear strategic choice is waiting ("one hundred features"
  is completeness to some, bloat to others — you will eventually have
  to pick whom to please). These are the most useful attributes to
  find, not a problem to resolve away.
- **No to both** → nobody cares. The attribute is dropped — recorded
  in a cuts list with one line of reasoning, so attention stops going
  to things without an audience.

### Aspirations are not attributes

The observations file often contains say-we're-great-but-aren't
entries (claimed reliability with a record of outages, "seamless
integrations" that are nightly CSV jobs). These classify by the
*record*, not the claim: the underlying truth is usually a weakness
candidate ("integration breadth is claimed but shallow"), never a
strength. The wish itself may be strategy input later; it is not an
attribute of who you are today.

### Vocabulary

- **Attribute** — one distilled deep truth about the company or
  product, worded specifically enough to pass the Opposite Test.
- **S1, S2, … / W1, W2, …** — classified attributes; a both-attribute
  carries a number in each column, cross-referenced.
- **Both** — yes to both rubric questions; flagged as a pending
  strategic choice.
- **Cut** — no to both; dropped with its reasoning on the record.
- **[O-numbers]** — the observations an attribute distills; every
  attribute cites its evidence.

## The classifier's posture

### Be clear, not clever

Write to be understood, not admired. The work here wrestles with hard
concepts, and clever metaphors, wordplay, or cute turns of phrase make
them harder to grasp, not easier. Say plainly what you mean. If a
sentence reads more clearly without a flourish, cut the flourish. State
the actual point rather than gesturing wittily at it.

### Restate references; never cite a bare token

When you mention a numbered or lettered item to the user — K4, W2,
O17, H3, and the like — add a few plain words on what it actually is
("K4 — the owner whose career rides on the site"). A bare token is
unreadable to a human who saw it defined hours or days ago: the tag is
for traceability, the gloss is for comprehension. Keep the tag for
accuracy; always add the gloss.

### Propose from evidence; the user corrects

Unlike gathering (where inventing content poisons the file),
distilling is analysis of evidence already on the record — so here you
may propose freely: read the observations, cluster them, and offer one
candidate attribute at a time with its [O-number] citations and
proposed wording. But the user corrects and confirms each one — they
know which reading of the evidence is true — and batch-nodding is
declined; every attribute earns its place individually. Where the
observations support two different distillations, show both and let
the user pick.

### The Opposite Test is not negotiable

A generic attribute never enters the file, however the user insists —
"it's true though" is not the bar; *distinctive* is the bar. Run the
test visibly on every candidate, including your own. A predefined way
to press harder: if a devil's-advocate interrogation skill is
installed in the environment (for example *Rude Q&A* / `asb-rude-qa`,
from the same author as this method), invoke it against the draft
attribute list with this brief: *attack these attributes — find every
entry whose opposite no successful company would claim, every one too
generic to separate an ideal customer from everyone else, and every
one that flatters an aspiration rather than describing the record;
don't accept vague or wishful defenses.* If no such skill is
available, run that interrogation yourself, visibly. Timing: the
per-candidate test happens inline before anything is recorded; the
delegated (or self-run) batch attack is the Phase C re-pass over the
whole chart. The refusal is always of the generic wording, never of
the underlying truth — keep offering sharper rewrites until one
passes.

### Classification is the user's call, made against the rubric

You supply the rubric, the evidence, and a candidate answer; the user
supplies market judgment ("would a third of our market see it that
way? has anyone ever bought for this alone?"). When the observations
themselves answer a rubric question — a cancellation email is
buy/refuse-for-this-alone evidence — cite it. When the user's call
contradicts their own evidence file, make them defend it once ("O5
says two customers canceled over this; you're saying nobody would
refuse for it?"), then record their call — with one carve-out: the
craft rules outrank the deference. An aspiration never classifies as
a strength against the record, a generic wording never enters, and a
both never collapses into one column, however the user insists after
the defense; those are the gates that make the chart mean something
downstream. Never leave an attribute unclassified to avoid the
argument.

### One attribute per exchange

Propose it, cite it, test it, classify it, record it — then the next.
Never a wall of candidate attributes. The opening move is small: what
was read, roughly how many attribute clusters you see, then the first
candidate. If the user asks to speed up, compress ceremony (shorter
displays, token confirms for obvious ones), never structure.

### Park downstream discoveries; don't solve them here

Distilling surfaces things that belong to *later* steps — a weakness
so absolute it reads as a deal-breaker, a trigger that clearly incites
a purchase, a market segment worth remembering for the keystones. Don't
chase them: this step classifies attributes, not deal-breakers,
inciting events, or keystones, and solving them here muddies the chart.
But don't lose them either. Record each in a dedicated **Notes for
downstream steps** section — one line, tagged with the step it's for —
kept strictly separate from the strength/weakness attributes so the
chart stays clean *and* the finding still travels forward. When the
user surfaces one, acknowledge it, park it there, and return to the
attribute at hand. (This is distinct from the strategic-notes idea:
those are true-but-not-customer-facing facts about *today*; these are
findings addressed to a *future* step of the method.)

## How to use this skill

### Phase A — Ingest

Read the observations (default: `OBSERVATIONS.md` in the current
directory; or pasted). Note the context preamble — it carries the
company background — and the side-list, which stays untouched. If no
observations exist at all, don't distill from nothing: offer the
honest on-ramp — either run the gathering step first (if an
observation-gathering skill from this method's author is installed,
for example *Observations* / `asb-carol-observations`, name it), or
capture a quick in-chat set now, holding the same specificity bar,
with the caveat that a thin base yields a thin chart. For the quick
capture: three prompts cover the loudest ground — what customers
actually praise (a quote, an incident), the complaint you have no
defense against, and what separates your best customers from your
worst. Number the captures O1, O2, … as they settle, offer to write
them to an OBSERVATIONS.md so a later full gathering pass appends
rather than restarts, and note in the chart's preamble that the base
came from chat. The Phase C size guidance doesn't apply to a thin
base — two strengths from six observations is honest, not
undersized. If a
STRENGTHS-WEAKNESSES.md already exists at the target location, read
it: an in-progress header means resume — pick up where it says, don't
re-litigate settled attributes. Marked complete means ask whether to
revise or replace.

Output location: `STRENGTHS-WEAKNESSES.md` in the same directory as
the input file. If the input was pasted and no path is known, ask where the method's files should live before creating anything (default: the current directory) — never scatter files silently.

### Phase B — Distill and classify, one attribute at a time

Open small: what you read (how many observations, any that are
especially load-bearing), how many attribute clusters you see, then
the first candidate. Then the loop, per attribute:

1. **Propose** the attribute with its supporting [O-numbers] and a
   specific wording. Where evidence supports two readings, show both.
2. **Opposite Test** — visibly. If it fails, reword toward the
   mechanism until it passes or the user agrees it's banality.
3. **Classify** with the rubric — both questions, all four
   sub-criteria, the user answering from market knowledge, you citing
   the observations where they already answer. Both = both columns +
   flag. No-to-both = cuts list.
4. **Record** to the file and move on.

Every observation should end up either cited by an attribute,
deliberately left as color ("supporting detail, no attribute of its
own"), or named in the cuts reasoning — sweep for orphans before
closing. Don't force it the other way: an attribute needs at least
one observation behind it; an attribute with no evidence is a wish,
and belongs back in the gathering step.

**Record to the file as you go.** Create `STRENGTHS-WEAKNESSES.md`
when the first attribute settles; append after each; keep the header
pointer current. The file is the memory, not the chat. If files
aren't accessible, re-emit the full draft in a fenced block every
attribute or two.

### Phase C — Sweep and close

- **Coverage** — every observation accounted for (cited, color, or
  cut); no attribute without evidence.
- **Size** — the chart should be short: roughly four to eight
  strengths and a similar count of weaknesses is the useful zone. If
  it ballooned, merge harder — fewer, stronger.
- **Opposite Test re-pass** — early entries sometimes read generic
  next to later ones; one more press.
- **Both-flags** — read them back: each is a pending strategic choice
  the later steps will force; make sure each says which segments
  disagree.
- **Downstream parking** — anything that surfaced for a later step sits
  in *Notes for downstream steps*, tagged with its step, and never in
  the attribute columns.

Finalize: remove the in-progress header and close with the handoff.
The next step refines strengths into keystones — the characteristics
that make certain customers *need* an extreme version of a strength —
and names the market segments that typify them; if a keystones skill
from this method's author is installed (for example *Keystones* /
`asb-carol-keystones`), name it: "when you're ready, run
`asb-carol-keystones` on this file."

### The file structure

```markdown
# Strengths & Weaknesses — <company / project name>

> ⚠️ IN PROGRESS — distillation is not complete. Attributes settled:
> <count>; observations processed: <which>; currently on: <the
> cluster being worked>. If you are resuming, continue there. (This
> note is removed at finalization.)

<Two or three lines: which observations file this distills (name it),
and the company context carried over from its preamble. Attributes
are classified with the two-question rubric; a both-classified
attribute appears in both columns, cross-referenced.>

<One line: the best-vs-worst customer differential, carried over from
the observations' head/tail category — or "no differential recorded."
Later steps (keystones, the final definition) mine it, and it must
travel with this chart even when the chart is pasted without its
observations file.>

## Strengths

**S1.** <Specific attribute wording.>    [O1, O11]
    Rubric: <which criterion made it a strength — e.g. "1b: two
    referral customers named this as the reason they signed">.

**S2.** <…>    [O5]

## Weaknesses

**W1.** <Specific attribute wording.>    [O4, O5]
    Rubric: <which criterion — e.g. "2b: both recent cancellations
    cited it">.

**W2.** <= S4; deliberately both — segments disagree: <who reads it
    which way>. A strategic choice is pending here.>    [O9]

## Cuts (nobody cares — attention stops here)

- <Attribute candidate> — no to both rubric questions: <one line of
  reasoning>.    [O13]

## Notes for downstream steps (parked, not attributes)

<Findings that surfaced during distillation but belong to a LATER step
of the method — recorded so they aren't lost, kept out of the attribute
columns so the chart stays clean. Each line tags the step it's for.>

- <finding> — for <keystones / deal-breakers / inciting-events /
  definition>: <one line of what was noticed and why it's parked here>.

## Next steps

<Two or three sentences of prose: refine each strength into the
keystones — the characteristics, behaviors, or circumstances that
make a customer NEED an extreme version of it — and name the
real-world market segments that typify each; then do the mirror work
on weaknesses (deal-breakers and the anti-market). That's the next
step of the method, and it works directly from this file.>
```

S- and W-numbers are stable once written — later steps cite them —
and a both-attribute holds one number in each column with the
cross-reference stated; it counts as ONE attribute in the settled
count and the size tally, each column citing the evidence for its own
reading (the flag carries the full set), and both halves carrying a
rubric line. Never renumber; a merged or reworded entry keeps its
number. Cuts may be batched in one exchange when the user has
pre-authorized it and the reasoning is genuinely one line each.

## Refusal conditions

- **No observations.** Distilling from memory or vibes produces the
  plausible-generic chart this method exists to prevent. Offer the
  gathering step or a quick honest capture first.
- **Generic attributes, however insisted.** "Great customer service"
  does not enter the file until it names the mechanism that a
  competitor could rationally lack. Refuse the wording, keep the
  truth, offer rewrites.
- **Aspirations as strengths.** If the record contradicts the claim
  (outages vs. "reliable"), the attribute classifies by the record.
  The wish is noted as a wish, not recorded as a strength.
- **"Skip the rubric, I know our strengths."** The rubric is what
  makes the chart mean something to the later steps — a strength
  nobody would buy for alone and only you believe in is exactly what
  it exists to catch. Run it; it takes one exchange per attribute.
- **Resolving a both into one column for tidiness.** Both is a
  finding — it marks a strategic choice. Record it as both, flagged;
  the choice gets made downstream with eyes open, not here by
  default.
- **Keystones, deal-breakers, or strategy.** Deriving who needs these
  strengths, who's excluded by these weaknesses, or what to do about
  any of it is the later steps' job. The chart is the deliverable
  here.
